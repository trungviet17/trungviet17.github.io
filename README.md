# 1. Introduction 
Greetings everyone, I'm Trung, a student from the Institute of Artificial Intelligence (IAI - UET - VNU). When I embarked on this blogging journey, I was just an average student with no remarkable accomplishments. During my studies and independent exploration, I accumulated a wealth of notes on Notion. This inspired me to create a blog - a blog dedicated to sharing my learnings and experiences about the world around me. Link:  [https://trungviet17.github.io/](https://trungviet17.github.io/) 

"The most effective way to learn something is to teach it to others."

# 2. Technical behind blog
To create this blog, you don't need any advanced skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, or any other related frameworks. I used a ready-made template from [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/). You can read the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1RYsmOMPLs) to customize the template to your liking.  However, to get a basic understanding of the structure of this blog, I will introduce you to Jekyll and hosting through a gitHub.io domain.

## 2.1 jekyll 
Jekyll is a simple blog framework that allows you to quickly convert .md files into static websites and blogs. The structure of the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/) template includes the following parts:

```
├── _data                       
│   ├── contact.yml             
│   └── share.yml               
├── _plugins                    
│    ├──post-lastmod-hook.rb    
│    └──watcher-patch.rb
├── assets                     
│   └── img
├── _tabs                       
│   ├── about.md
│   ├── archives.md

│   └── tags.md
├── _posts                      
│   ├── sample-post.md

└── _config.yml
```

# 3. Content 
In this blog, I will mainly write about the knowledge I have learned and found related to the fields of AI, mathematics, and economics and finance:
